# Project Outline

E-commerce Churn Prediction with Synthetic Data
Project Status: Work in Progress

## Overview

This project focuses on building an end-to-end churn prediction model for an e-commerce business using synthetically generated data. The synthetic data will incorporate various churn patterns, simulating realistic customer behavior. The project will cover data generation, exploration, model development, and deployment using Streamlit.

## Key Components:

### Synthetic Data Generation
    
- Generate e-commerce data including customers, products, orders, and website interactions using Python libraries like faker, numpy, and pandas.

- Implement multiple churn patterns (sudden and gradual) with varying decline functions to create a diverse and realistic dataset.

### Data Exploration and Analysis

- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the generated data.

- Visualize churn patterns and identify key features that might be indicative of churn.

### Churn Prediction Model Development

- Preprocess the data and engineer relevant features for churn prediction.
- Train and evaluate various machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) to predict customer churn.
- Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

### Streamlit Deployment
- Build an interactive Streamlit application to:
    - Visualize key metrics and insights from the data.
    - Make predictions using the trained churn model.

### Project Goals:

- Demonstrate proficiency in synthetic data generation with complex patterns.
- Showcase data exploration and analysis skills.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for churn prediction.
- Deploy an interactive application using Streamlit.
